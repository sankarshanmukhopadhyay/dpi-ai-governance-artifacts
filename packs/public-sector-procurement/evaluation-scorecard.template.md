# Procurement Evaluation Scorecard (Template)

This scorecard is intended to be used consistently across bids.
It supports both “minimum gate” checks and weighted scoring.

## Gate checks (pass/fail)

- Submitted Vendor Capability Attestation (schema-backed)
- Submitted at least one Decision Receipt sample
- Submitted redress workflow description and appeal process
- Submitted supply-chain control declarations

## Weighted scoring (example)

| Category | Weight | What “good” looks like |
|---|---:|---|
| Accountability & auditability | 25 | Decision receipts are complete, emitted for high-impact decisions, and have clear ownership |
| Authority & delegation | 20 | Delegations are explicit, bounded, and linked to oversight |
| Change-control & triggers | 15 | Rulebook changes are versioned; triggers are declared and actionable |
| Redress & remediation | 25 | Redress workflows are operational, measured, and evidenced; appeals are usable |
| Supply chain & vendor maturity | 15 | Dependency controls and attestations are concrete and verifiable |

## Notes

- Adjust weights per program criticality and tier.
- Require evidence for claims. Prefer artifacts over narratives.
