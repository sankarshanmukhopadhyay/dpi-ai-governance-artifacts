# Public Sector AI Procurement — Operational Pack

This pack translates DPI+AI governance requirements into **procurement-ready language**:
vendor attestations, evidence requests, evaluation scorecards, and baseline contract clauses.

It is designed for:
- Procurement teams issuing RFP/RFQ
- Program owners defining governance requirements
- Vendors responding with evidence

## Scope

In-scope:
- Vendor capability attestation (structured, schema-backed)
- Supply-chain controls and dependency evidence
- Standard evidence request list (mapped to artifacts in this repo)
- Evaluation scorecard template (repeatable assessment)

Out-of-scope:
- Jurisdiction-specific legal drafting (treat the clause templates as starting points)

## Adoption path

1. **Choose a governance tier**
   - Use the repo’s tier profile(s) as the policy anchor.
2. **Issue an evidence request**
   - Use the Evidence Request template to ask for concrete artifacts.
3. **Collect vendor attestations**
   - Require a schema-backed capability attestation payload.
4. **Score responses**
   - Apply the scorecard consistently across bidders.
5. **Contractualize**
   - Use baseline clause templates to pin expectations into the contract.

## Primary outputs

- Evidence request packet (RFP annex)
- Vendor capability attestation (JSON)
- Supply-chain controls evidence
- Procurement evaluation scorecard

## Included artifacts

See [`manifest.yaml`](./manifest.yaml) for the exact inventory.
