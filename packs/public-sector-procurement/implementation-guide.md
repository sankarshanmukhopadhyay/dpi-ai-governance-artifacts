# Public Sector AI Procurement — Implementation Guide

This pack shifts governance **left** into procurement by specifying evidence requirements, evaluation criteria, and enforceable clauses.

## How to use
- Use `evidence-request.template.md` to request artifacts from suppliers.
- Use `evaluation-scorecard.template.md` to score responses.
- Use `procurement-clauses.template.md` to bake requirements into contracts.
- Add `supplier-attestation.template.md` to capture binding claims.

## Tiering
Where possible, require tier-conditional governance artifacts (e.g., decision receipts, redress SLAs, evidence bundles).
