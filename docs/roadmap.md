# Roadmap (Schedule-Free)

This roadmap captures the intended evolution of the DPI AI Governance Artifacts repository.  
It is directional and architectural in nature. It does not imply delivery dates.

---

## 1. Operational Pack Expansion

- Minimum Digital Kernel operational pack
- Meta-Governance implementation pack
- AI Redress and Accountability pack
- Public Sector AI Procurement pack
- Delegated Agent Governance pack

Goal: Move from conceptual framing to reusable, implementation-ready artifact bundles.

---

## 2. Control Library & Control IDs

- Standardize control ID format (e.g., DPI-AI-CTRL-XX)
- Introduce control categorization (Governance, Risk, Assurance, Redress, Transparency)
- Create machine-readable control registry (JSON/YAML)
- Crosswalk to NIST AI RMF, OECD AI Principles, ISO 42001 (where applicable)

Goal: Enable traceable, machine-operable governance controls.

---

## 3. Schema & Machine-Readable Hardening

- Formalize JSON schemas for all artifacts
- Add validation examples
- Introduce schema versioning policy
- Provide example conformant artifact bundles

Goal: Ensure artifacts are automatable and audit-ready.

---

## 4. Evidence & Conformance Layer

- Define artifact-to-control mapping model
- Introduce lightweight conformance declaration template
- Provide example “evidence bundle” for at least one pack
- Document minimum viable audit trail

Goal: Transition from advisory artifacts to assurance-ready components.

---

## 5. Reference Implementations

- Publish sample filled artifacts
- Provide illustrative governance case study
- Add redlined comparison examples (weak vs strong governance posture)

Goal: Improve usability and reduce interpretive ambiguity.

---

## 6. Adoption & Integration Guidance

- “How to use this repo” implementation guide
- Suggested adoption pathways (startup, enterprise, state)
- Maturity model alignment
- FAQ for practitioners

Goal: Lower the cognitive barrier to adoption.

---

## 7. Ecosystem Alignment

- Map artifacts to emerging AI governance standards
- Document compatibility considerations
- Track alignment gaps transparently

Goal: Ensure long-term interoperability.

---

## Tracking Philosophy

This roadmap captures architectural intent and sequencing logic.  
Items may evolve, merge, or reprioritize based on ecosystem needs.

No timeline commitments are implied.
