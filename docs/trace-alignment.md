# TRACE Alignment

This repository contains **TRACE-aligned operational artifacts**.

**TRACE (Trust, Risk, Architecture & Conformance Evaluation)** is defined in the DPI AI Governance Lab repository and provides the normative evaluation method. This repository provides templates, schemas, playbooks, and checklists that operationalize TRACE controls.

## Alignment contract

- TRACE version: see `TRACE_VERSION`
- Lab reference: `dpi-ai-governance-lab` (TRACE docs live under `docs/trace/`; stabilized review methodology lives under `methodology/`)
- This repo provides a traceability map from TRACE controls → artifact files.

## Traceability

- Human-readable: `docs/traceability.md`
- Machine-readable: `docs/traceability.json`

## Non-goals

- This repository does not redefine TRACE scoring or controls.
- If controls change, update the traceability map and bump versions accordingly.
