# Migration Note --- Structural Shift in v0.7.0

## Overview

Version v0.7.0 introduces a structural reorganization of the DPI AI
Governance Artifacts repository.

This release transitions the repository from a collection of governance
artifacts into a formally structured governance system with:

-   A constitutional governance spine
-   A controlled-document taxonomy
-   Explicit normative drafting discipline
-   Formalized redress architecture
-   Compatibility mapping to Trust Over IP (ToIP) structural principles

No schema logic changes were introduced in this release.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What Changed

### 1. Governance Spine Added

A new `governance/` directory establishes:

-   `primary.md` --- constitutional governance definition
-   `normative-language.md` --- RFC 2119 drafting discipline
-   `schedule-of-controlled-docs.md` --- authoritative document index

All normative interpretation now flows from this spine.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2. Controlled Document Taxonomy Introduced

Artifacts are now organized under:

-   `controlled/risk/`
-   `controlled/assurance/`
-   `controlled/redress/`

Reserved categories include:

-   `controlled/technical/`
-   `controlled/info-trust/`
-   `controlled/inclusion-accessibility/`
-   `controlled/legal/`

Risk, assurance, and redress documents are now modular and independently
versionable.

Legacy folders remain as navigational pointers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3. Redress & Remediation Formalized

A new redress controlled document defines:

-   Escalation pathways
-   Remediation closure evidence
-   Accountability linkage

This strengthens institutional credibility for public-sector DPI AI
deployment contexts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4. Normativity Clarified

Artifact types are now explicitly defined:

-   Policy
-   Rule
-   Schema
-   Profile
-   Evidence
-   Template
-   Test Vector

A normativity matrix distinguishes binding from illustrative materials.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Breaking Changes

Document paths have changed for:

-   Risk materials → `controlled/risk/`
-   Conformance materials → `controlled/assurance/`

Update any downstream references or automation tied to prior directory
structures.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What Did NOT Change

-   Governance philosophy
-   TRACE methodology
-   Risk-tier model
-   Evidence bundle expectations
-   Schema content

This release restructures architecture, not governance substance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Alignment Note

Structural discipline in this release draws inspiration from:

Trust Over IP (ToIP) Governance Metamodel Specification (V1.0)\
Trust Over IP (ToIP) Governance Metamodel Companion Guide (V1.0)

The repository is compatible with, but not a compliant Trust Over IP
(ToIP) Governance Framework.
