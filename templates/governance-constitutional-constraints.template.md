# Governance Constitutional Constraints (Template)

Use this template to define **non-derogable constraints** and hard limits on governance power — the “constitution layer”.

> Intent: prevent governance drift, emergency overreach, and silent erosion of rights.

## 1. Non-derogable rights / guarantees

- **Right to notice**: impacted parties MUST receive a decision receipt for consequential decisions.
- **Right to contest**: impacted parties MUST have an appeal path with clear timelines.
- **Right to explanation**: receipts MUST include reason codes and provenance links to rulebooks.
- **Right to human review**: define thresholds where human review is mandatory.

## 2. Automation limits

- Decisions that MUST NOT be fully automated:
  - [List decision types / jurisdictions]
- Mandatory human review thresholds:
  - [e.g., Tier 2+; financial hardship; denial of critical service]

## 3. Emergency powers

- Emergency override conditions:
  - [Define explicit triggers]
- Emergency overrides MUST:
  - be time-bounded
  - be logged with rationale
  - trigger post-hoc review and publication

## 4. Rule change constraints

- Any change that increases risk tier MUST:
  - require dual control approval
  - include an impact assessment
  - provide a public notice / consultation record (where applicable)

## 5. Delegation constraints

- All delegations MUST have:
  - a review interval
  - a sunset date or explicit renewal requirement
  - revocation conditions
- Delegation records MUST be auditable and retrievable.

## 6. Publication & transparency

- Minimum transparency commitments:
  - [Scorecard cadence]
  - [Public artifact list]
  - [Redaction rules]

## 7. Annex: Evidence bundle checklist

- Delegation record present and active
- Oversight-review current
- Rulebook change controls complete
- Decision receipt coverage validated
- Appeals SLA measured
