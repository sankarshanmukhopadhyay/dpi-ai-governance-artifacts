# Registry Correction SLA Metrics

Track these metrics per registry and per service that consumes registry facts.

## Timeliness
- Time to acknowledge correction request (P50, P95)
- Time to decide correction request (P50, P95)
- Time to apply correction (P50, P95)

## Quality
- Reopen rate (corrections that were reversed or disputed)
- Appeal rate (corrections that escalated to appeals)
- Error rate (confirmed registry errors per 10,000 records)

## Remedy effectiveness
- Recompute completion time after correction
- Percentage of affected decisions recomputed
- Percentage of recomputed decisions that changed outcome

## Transparency
- Percentage of correction responses that are signed
- Coverage of reason codes for denial decisions
