# Rulebook test vectors

This folder is a scaffold for publishing test vectors for rulebooks.

Recommended layout per rulebook version:

- `vectors/<rulebook_id>/<version>/inputs.json`
- `vectors/<rulebook_id>/<version>/expected.json`

A rulebook manifest should reference the vector set and expected results.
