# Legacy location: `artifacts/`

The content that used to live in `artifacts/` has been reorganized into **controlled documents** under `controlled/`.

Use these instead:

- Risk Register → `controlled/risk/risk-register.md`
- Risk Scoring Matrix → `controlled/risk/risk-scoring-matrix.md`
- Transparency Scorecard → `controlled/assurance/transparency-scorecard.md`

Rationale: controlled documents provide clearer versioning, normativity, and navigation for adopters.
