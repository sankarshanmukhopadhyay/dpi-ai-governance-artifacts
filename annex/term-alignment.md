# Annex: Minimal terminology alignment (ToIP ↔ DPI–AI)

This annex helps avoid semantic drift when referencing ToIP vocabulary.

- **Governance Framework (GF)** (ToIP): a blueprint for a trust community’s policies/rules.
  - Here: treat the repository as an **artifact catalog + governance spine**, not a complete ecosystem GF.

- **Policy** (ToIP): human-auditable requirement.
  - Here: policies live primarily in `controlled/**` documents.

- **Rule** (ToIP): machine-testable requirement.
  - Here: rules are expressed as schemas and test vectors today; rules-engine formats may follow.

- **Controlled document** (ToIP): modular governance document category.
  - Here: `controlled/**` directories.

- **Trust assurance / certification** (ToIP): accountability scheme and evidence expectations.
  - Here: `controlled/assurance/**` (evidence bundles, tier profiles).
